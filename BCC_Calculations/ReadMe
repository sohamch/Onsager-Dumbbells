** Important - It is recommended that the user go through the FCC notebooks for Ni-X alloys and tracers, since
they are simpler, more heavily annotated and elucidate the working of the code.

Data File Descriptions:
-> All hdf5 data files : "Cr_data.h5", "Cu_data.h5" etc are generated using Green's Function method
-> Files named "PDC_ratio_X.dat" - contains the PDC ratios for Fe-X obtained from Messina et. al.'s database.
-> Files named "DragRatio_X.dat" - contains the drag ratios for Fe-X obtained from Messina et. al.'s database.

-> All data for Fe-X alloys are generated in the correspondingly named folders.

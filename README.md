### A Green's function method to calculate transport coefficients for interstitial dumbbell mediated diffusion in the dilute limit.
-> This is a preliminary release and requires pre-installed Onsager package: https://github.com/DallasTrinkle/Onsager. The current dumbbell implementations will later be incorporated into the main Onsager package itself.

-> Zenodo DOI : 10.5281/zenodo.4312664

-> It is recommended that a new user first go through the tracer correlation factor calculation and the Ni-X alloy calculations in the Jupyter notebooks in the "FCC_Calculations" folder.

-> The BCC_Calculations folders contain the Fe-X alloys' calculations and results are compared with Messina et. al. (doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2020.03.038)

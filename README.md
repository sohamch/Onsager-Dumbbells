-> It is recommended that a new user first go through the tracer correlation factor calculation and the Ni-X alloy calculations in the Jupyter notebooks in the "FCC_Calculations" folder.
-> The BCC_Calculations folders contain the Fe-X alloys' calculations and results are compared with Messina et. al. (doi.org/10.1016/j.actamat.2020.03.038)
